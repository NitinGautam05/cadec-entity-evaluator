form I-Symptom
in O
my O
head O
during O
conversations O
, O
was O
disturbing B-Symptom
and O
couldn't O
figure O
out O
why O
these O
things O
were O
happening O
. O
made O
me O
think O
i O
needed O
antidepressants B-Drug
or O
something O
to O
deal O
with O
constant B-Symptom
anxiety/fear I-Symptom
( O
which O
i O
have O
taken O
before O

are O
horrible B-ADR
to O
get I-ADR
off O
of O
) O
have O
noticed O
slightly O
more O
tingling B-Symptom
and O
weird B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O

a O
perfect O
time O
to O
stop O
taking O
this O
. O

I O
did O
take O
the O
actual O
lipitor B-Drug
for O
several O
