I O  
would O  
rather O  
die O  
than O  
take O  
this B-Drug  
again O  
. O  
Although O  
It O  
works O  
wonders O  
for O  
my O  
back B-Symptom  
pain I-Symptom  
, O  
it O  
is O  
not O  
worth O  
it O

go O  
through O  
the O  
uterus B-Symptom  
pain I-Symptom  
and O  
cramping I-Symptom  
. O  
I O  
am O  
going O

and O  
find O  
a O  
sister B-Drug  
drug I-Drug  
to O  
arthrotec B-Drug  
. O  
Its O  
weird O

taking O  
this B-Drug  
drug I-Drug  
off O  
and O  
on O

I O  
have O  
no O  
way O  
of O  
knowing O  
when O  
it O  
will O  
randomly O  
happen O  
and O  
it O  
is O  
not O  
worth O  
it O  
to O  
take O  
that O  
risk O  
. O  
I O  
have O  
began O  
to O  
think O  
it O  
has O  
something O  
to O  
do O  
with O  
the O  
day O  
of O  
my O  
cycle O  
affecting O  
how O  
bad O  
the O  
pains O  
will O  
be O
